                    Since building my first computer I have built multiple systems for friends and family. This has included optimising hardware specifications whilst observing budget constraints. I would build the systems and setup the operating system and requested programs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I have built and managed a homelab and self-hosted multiple services on Hyper-V such as Plex, FreeNAS, Bludit and Windows Server
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I also enjoy keeping up to date with world events and current affairs, news and trends within the computing industry by subscribing to tech news outlets such as <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/">anandtech</a> and <a href="https://www.guru3d.com/">guru3d</a>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I have also created projects using Raspberry Pi’s, Arduino’s and the CHIP microcomputer, such as a wireless speaker and a PI hole (advertisement and internet tracker blocking application)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I have an interest in 3D printing. One project of note, I designed and printed a keyboard, as well as hand wired the keys together using a Teensy microcontroller.
